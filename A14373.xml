            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>IAcob Verſlyn</hi> was ſeiſed in Fee of the lands in queſtion, vnder whoſe eſtate all the parties claime. And the ſaid <hi>Iacob Verſlyn</hi> hauing in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health trauelled in perſon to Maſter Serieant <hi>Foſter,</hi> and vſed his counſell and aduiſe in making of a Will, <hi>dat.</hi> 23. <hi>Iulij</hi> 1601. wherein he ſetled his lands in the name of the <hi>Verſlyns,</hi> and publiſhed the ſame in Merchantailors Hall and there left the Duplicate thereof with a purpoſe neuer to reuoke the ſame.</p>
            <p>That the defendants (who now ſeeke the reuerſal of the decree in Chancery <hi>by Act of Parliament,</hi> taking aduantage of the old mans weaknes both of bodie and memorie, being no way able to go abroad and alſo of the Plaintifes impriſonment) by falſe Rumors, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> the pl' had ſaid hee was aſhamed of his Parents and would chaunge his name; That his Mother was a Whore; to one Doctor <hi>Nowell</hi> her ſon in law &amp; to <hi>Petula</hi> a Broker, and that <hi>Francis</hi> the Plaintife had ſold his Patrimony for 700. pounds and had receiued in hand 300. pounds and had taken part with <hi>Sir Ieram Bowes</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Iacob</hi> his Father. Vpon theſe vntrue reports (making the ſaid <hi>Iacobs</hi> wife the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument) they cauſed the ſaid <hi>Iacob,</hi> being aged 84. yeares and vpwards to alter his ſaid will, and to diſinherite his ſaid eldeſt ſonne <hi>Francis</hi> and to ſettle the lands vpon the defendants and their wiues his daughters, they hauing great portions with their wiues in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; The juſt and legall proceedings of the ſaid ſuite appeareth as followeth.</p>
            <p>The ſuite for this land after the death of <hi>Iacob,</hi> betweene the ſaid <hi>Francis</hi> his ſonne and the defendants his daughters, and their husbands was in the Chauncerie before the Lord <hi>Elleſmere,</hi> whoſe care was ſo great to doe Iuſtice in this cauſe; That after ſolempne hearing thereof three whole dayes togeather in one Terme in open Court in Chauncery; It was vpon the <hi>fourth</hi> day of <hi>February</hi> 9. <hi>Iacobi</hi> ordered, that the ſaid Plaintife ſhould exhibite an Information in the Starrechamber for the ſaid practiſes &amp;c. That ſo his Lordſhip might haue the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of that honorable court, for his better Iudgement in the cauſe.</p>
            <p>That in the ſaid ſuit in Starrechamber the defendants as to the vndue practiſes in procuring the ſaid laſt will pleaded the generall pardon, and praied the benefit thereof, So as the Court could not proceed to Sentence: And as to the forging and publiſhing of the Deed of Feoffment of part of the lands pretended to be made by old <hi>Iacob</hi> to <hi>Peter Manning</hi> and his wife, the ſaid <hi>Manning</hi> and <hi>Say</hi> (being the defendants char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged therewith) pleaded not guiltie; And as to the miſdemeanor in obtayning the ſaid deed they pleaded the generall Pardon, as appeareth by the order made in that Court. 27. <hi>Maij</hi> 12. <hi>Iacobi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That vpon hearing of the cauſe in Starrechamber, the Court did find very ſtrong, &amp; maine preſumptions, that the ſaid deed was forged, and counterfete yet forbeare to giue Sentence not hauing full, and apparant proofe thereof in regard of the heauineſſe of a Sentence for ſuch an offence as appeares by the ſaid order, being the words of the Sentence there.</p>
            <p>That after the hearing and order in Starrechamber, the cauſe was againe ſolempnly heard three whole daies togeather in open Court in Chauncerie, aſwell vpon the depoſitions in Chauncerie as in the Starrechamber, and decreed for the plaintife 12. <hi>Iulij</hi> 12. <hi>Iacobi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That after the death of the Lord Chauncellor <hi>Elleſmere,</hi> the defendants exhibited a new bill in Chauncery of reuiew and reuerſal of the former decree: And that vpon ſolempne hearing in open Court, the ſaid former decret was confirmed, and the plaintifes Bill diſmiſſed as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the ſaid ſecond decree <hi>dated:</hi> 12 <hi>Februarij</hi> 16. <hi>Iacobi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the end and ſcope of the ſaid originall decree is to ſettle the ſtate and poſſeſſion of the lands of old <hi>Iacob Verſlyn</hi> in <hi>Francis</hi> his eldeſt ſon as heire at Common law againſt the ſaid pretended laſt will, and deed of feoffement.</p>
            <p>That it is now about 7. yeares ſince the firſt decree in Chauncerie ſince which time the plaintife <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> his yonger brother one of the defendants are dead, and that the lands are now in the hands of ſeuerall purchaſors, and that the children and creditors of the ſaid <hi>Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> are to be relieued out of the moneys receiued, and to be receiued for the ſaid lands as appeares by the will of the ſaid <hi>Francis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it is not pretended by the <hi>Bill in Parliament</hi> that any of the decrees or orders were obtained by bribes or rewards, or any Indirect courſe whatſoeuer, But it is ſuggeſted that the ſaid former decree in Chauncerie was grounded vpon many miſtaken and miſconceiued ſuggeſtions not ſufficiently proued, which is a very vntrue ſurmiſe, &amp; altogeather improbable conſidering the great wiſedom, experience &amp; vnderſtanding of the then Lord Chancellor, togeather with his great care and deliberation in hearing of the ſaid cauſe in both Courts, and there being no briberie or corruption obiected againſt him, the ſaid Decree being likewiſe grounded vpon many effectuall proofes and reaſons not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the ſaid Bill, and yet they now lay an imputation vpon him being dead.</p>
            <p>That if way be giuen to ſuch improbable and ſcandalous pretences as thereby to queſtion this decree made vpon ſo many ſolemne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate hearings, both in the Starrechamber and Chauncerie, and confirmed by a ſucceeding Lord Chauncellor by a ſecond decree in Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie vpon a Bill of review exhibited by the ſaid defendants, many moſt juſt Decrees wilbe queſtioned, and the Rights and poſſeſſions of many clayming by and vnder them diſturbed; which alſo will tend to the generall diſgrace of the Decrees of that High Court, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the great trouble of this honorable Houſe, in the examination of ſuch improbable, ſcandalous pretences;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THat therefore this Honourable</hi> HOVSE <hi>will bee pleaſed, to conſider the dangerous Conſequent of ſuch a Preſident, and to Diſmiſſe the ſayd Bill.</hi>
